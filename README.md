## Description

This project combines a Flask backend with a modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend to create a comprehensive personal health tracking system. Users can securely log in, track various health metrics (weight, exercise, water intake, mood), view interactive charts, and access personalized insights about their health journey.

**Problem it solves**: Managing personal health data across multiple platforms can be fragmented and insecure. This application provides a centralized, privacy-focused solution for individuals to track and analyze their health metrics over time.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd personal-health-tracker
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install flask
```

4. **Create project structure**
```bash
mkdir templates static
```

5. **Set up the template file**
   - Save the HTML content as `templates/lab7.html`
   - Ensure the HTML file includes all the CSS and JavaScript inline

## Usage

1. **Start the Flask application**
```bash
python app.py
```

2. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Log in with demo credentials (see Examples section)
   - Start tracking your health metrics

3. **Navigate the application**
   - **Dashboard**: View your health statistics and charts
   - **Add Record**: Input daily health metrics
   - **Records**: View and manage your health history
   - **Goals**: Set and track health goals
   - **Insights**: Get personalized health insights

## Examples

## API Reference

### Authentication Endpoints

#### `GET /`
Returns the login page or redirects to dashboard if already authenticated.

#### `POST /login`
Authenticates user credentials.

**Parameters:**
- `username` (string): User's username
- `password` (string): User's password

**Response:**
- Success: Redirect to `/dashboard`
- Error: Login page with error message

#### `GET /logout`
Logs out the user and clears session.

### Application Routes

#### `GET /dashboard`
Main dashboard with health statistics and charts.
**Requires authentication**

#### `GET /add_record`
Form for adding new health records.
**Requires authentication**

#### `GET /history`
View historical health records.
**Requires authentication**

#### `GET /register`
User registration page (placeholder).

### Frontend JavaScript API

The frontend includes a `HealthTracker` class with methods:
- `saveRecord()` - Save health data to localStorage
- `updateDashboard()` - Refresh dashboard statistics
- `renderChart()` - Generate Chart.js visualizations
- `editRecord(id)` - Edit existing health records
- `deleteRecord(id)` - Remove health records

## Configuration

### Flask Configuration
```python
app.secret_key = 'your_super_secret_key_here'  # Change this in production
```

### User Management
Currently uses in-memory user storage:
```python
users = {
    'user1': 'pass1',
    'user2': 'pass2'
}
```

### Health Goals (Frontend)
Default goals can be modified in the JavaScript:
```javascript
this.goals = {
    targetWeight: 70,
    weeklyExercise: 150,
}
```
